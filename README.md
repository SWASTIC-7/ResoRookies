# ðŸŽ¶ ResoRookies

ResoRookies is a real-time collaborative music player that allows users to listen to synchronized music across multiple devices. Built with WebSocket technology, it ensures that everyone in a group hears the same song at the same time, no matter where they are.

## ðŸŒŸ Features

- **Real-time Syncing**: Ensures all devices play the music in perfect synchronization.
- **Group Listening**: Multiple users can join a session and listen together.
- **Remote Control**: A master device controls playback, while all other devices follow in sync.
- **Cross-Device Compatibility**: Works on any device with a browser.
- **Easy to Use**: Simple and intuitive interface to start a synchronized music session.
  
## ðŸš€ Getting Started
